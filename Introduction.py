flavours of python:
1- JPython
2- PyPy
3- Anaconda Python
4- CPython(Core Python)
What is Python:
Python is a general purpose(used eveywhere), dynamically typed(no need to define data type),high level language(seems more like english lang).
Developed by Guido Veb Rossum in 1991
Python name came from a comedy show(Monty's Python flying)that interested the developer so much to name his created language as Python.
It is a interpreter language.As it gives result for everyline code.
In this language we just have to write the logic to have result
To print a result we may write the string in single or double qoutes as per our ease
e.g. Print("Hello World")
Print('Hello World')
Both are true conditions.
Interpreter also guides us about our mistakes line by line.
You can do coding on cmd by opening python in it simply by writing py key
To write long programs we can also open IDLE Shell Python that comes with Python builtin by simply clicking on windows button and searching
IDLE Shell Python.Go to the shell and open a new file by ctrl+N it is now ready to compile long programs. Press F5 to Run the program written.
Or you may use VS code or Pycharm for the purpose.
Features:
1- simple and easy to learn
2- Freeware and open source(you can do changes in it by yourself)
3- platform independent(program ctreated can be used and run in any system and portfolio)
4- Rich library(For every Job Python have libraries which can be imported and used)
5- Portable
6- Embeded programming language(Code of C language or Java can be embeded in python hence used)
7- Extensible programming language(Code of Python can be used in other languages like C and Java)
8- Interpreted programming language(It has a interpreter that interprets line by line execution) 
Applications of Python/Why Python is so important??:
1- Web Development
2- Game Development
3- IoT programming 
4- Machine Learning 
5- AI
6- DataBase programming
7- Network programming
Limitations:
1- We can not make mobile applications using Python
2- It's performance is not up to the mark.
