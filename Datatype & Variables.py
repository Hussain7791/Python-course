'''
Datatype:
It represents different type of values that we store on the variables.
Types:
1- Numbers
2- String
3- Dictonairy{contains a key and attributes}   Doesn't allows duplicate key.If used then it prints latest value 
4- Set{}    It doesn't accepts duplicate values 
5- List[]   It can accept duplicate values 
6- Tuple()  It also accepts duplicate values 
We don't need to specify the datatype in python as interpreter itself Judges the type by values 
That's why Python is dynamical type language
e.g If a=10;
type<int> types is derived by the interpreter from the value 
Variable:
It is a name of memory location where we can store different type of values
If you want to use a value multiple times then you have to store it in a variable 
e.g print('hussain')
or a= 'hussain'
print(a)
Type():
It returns the datatype of the given values.
